# ServiceObject.AsJsonObject method

Returns a `System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonObject` that is temporarily associated with this `ServiceObject`.

```csharp
public JsonObject AsJsonObject()
```

## Remarks

If the returned object is mutated, the `ServiceObject` is mutated. However, once the `ServiceObject` is accessed in any other way, including serialization, the object may or may not remain associated with the `ServiceObject` and thus should no longer be used.
